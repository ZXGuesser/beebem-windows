      <h1>Econet Support</h1>

      <p>
        BeebEm emulates an Econet network using AUN compatible protocols.
        This allows multiple instances of BeebEm to communicate with other, and
        with other AUN compatible software and machines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Econet support is enabled from the <span class="ui">Hardware</span> menu
        in BeebEm. Also switch off <span class="ui">Freeze when inactive</span>
        if you intend to run multiple instances of BeebEm so they can all run at
        the same time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each machine attached to an Econet has a station number (between 1 and
        254) associated with it, and each Econet has a net number (between 1 and 
        127). BeebEm allows instances to be defined on different nets and
        transparently routes packets between them as if the two networks were
        connected via an Econet bridge.
      </p>

      <p>
        BeebEm emulates an Econet using IP datagrams. Each station on the
        network needs a unique IP address and port number combination and each
        instance of BeebEm also needs to know the address and port number of
        the other instances on the network.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        BeebEm is able to assign itself an address and identify other instances on
        the network using an automatic host discovery protocol. However everything
        can still be configured manually using the 
        <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span> and
        <span class="file">AUNMap</span> files.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span> file has been set up to
        enable automatic configuration and and gateway discovery. Read the notes
        in the <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span> file for more information.
      </p>

      <p>
        The simplest way to get started is to enable automatic configuration in 
        <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span> which will assign a random station
        number to each new instance of BeebEm.
        <br>
        To specify a specific number to start an instance on station 254 for a
        file server, use the <a href="commandline.html">-EcoStn</a> option
        <code>-EcoStn 254</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also specify the <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span> and <span
        class="file">AUNMap</span> file names on the command line, using the
        <code>-EconetCfg</code> and <code>-AUNMap</code>
        options. Refer to the <a href="commandline.html">command line
        options</a> for more details.
      </p>

      <h2>File Server</h2>

      <p>
        An Econet file server enables a disk file system to be shared by all of
        the stations on the network. Acorn produced various versions of file
        server software. The level 1 and 2 file server software is included in
        disk images with BeebEm. The server software must be run on station
        number 254.
      </p>

      <p>
        To run the level 1 server, load the <span class="file">econet_level_1_utils.ssd</span>
        disk image on station 254, and run the file server by typing
        <span class="cmd">CH."FS"</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be prompted for:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Number of files per user - enter <span class="cmd">3</span></li>
        <li>Manual configuration - enter <span class="cmd">Y</span></li>
        <li>Directory for first station - enter <span class="cmd">A</span></li>
        <li>Station number - just press <kbd>Enter</kbd></li>
        <li>Directory for second station - enter <span class="cmd">B</span></li>
        <li>Station number - just press <kbd>Enter</kbd></li>
        <li>Directory for third station - just press <kbd>Enter</kbd></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The file server will then start running and report that it is ready.
      </p>

      <p>
        The level 2 server is a little more complicated to set up. It requires
        the 6502 second processor support to be enabled and requires a special
        "master" disk to be formatted (must be a double sided disk). I suggest
        you read the "The Econet Level 2 Fileserver Manager's Guide" (available
        at <a href="http://www.bbcdocs.com/">BBC Docs</a>) if you want to set
        up a level 2 server.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use the Econet file system from a station you will need to have a ROM
        installed that supports the Econet file system (such as the Acorn DNFS
        ROM installed in Model B mode). To switch a station into Econet file
        system mode press <kbd>N</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd>. The Econet station
        number should be shown on screen. To switch without pressing the break
        key type <span class="cmd">*NET</span>. You can then use commands such
        as <span class="cmd">*CAT</span>, <span class="cmd">LOAD</span>, <span
        class="cmd">SAVE</span> and <span class="cmd">CHAIN</span> to access
        files on the server.
      </p>

      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

      <p>
        The Econet emulation in BeebEm is not perfect and is susceptible to
        timing issues. When a message is being sent between stations BeebEm
        waits for a short time for the Econet to become free again before
        sending the next message. If the delay is too small messages can
        interfere with each other and cause a "Net Error" to be reported. If it
        is too long a station can report "Line Jammed". The waiting time is set
        by default to 100000 cycles (0.05s) but can be overridden by a command
        line option <span class="cmd">-EcoFF</span>. If you see "Net Error"
        report try a <span class="cmd">-EcoFF 500000</span>, for "Line Jammed"
        try <span class="cmd">-EcoFF 50000</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emulation is also sensitive to the Econet scout ACK timeout value,
        controlled by the <span class="cmd">SCACKTIMEOUT</span>
        (or <span class="cmd">SCOUTACKTIMEOUT</span>) setting in
        <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span>. Setting this value too low
        will cause Econet commands to fail, hang, or command output to contain
        garbage or blank lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        The automatic host discovery protocol uses packets which are based on
        the AUN protocol but have an invalid AUN packet type. This may cause
        issues when used on a network with original AUN hardware and disrupts
        Econet emulation in older versions of BeebEm. All automated address
        configuration can be disabled by deactivating the <span
        class="cmd">AUTOCONFIGURE</span> setting in <span class="file">Econet.cfg</span>
