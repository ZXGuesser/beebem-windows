//
// TODO:
// * Samples repeat over and over in the 'eprom' test mode. Needs investigation.
// * Implement a ready callback for pc interfaces
//   - this will be quite a challenge since for it to be really accurate
//     the whole emulation has to run in sync (lots of timers) with the
//     cpu cores.
// * If a command is still executing, /READY will be kept high until the command
//   has finished if the next command is written.
// * tomcat has a 5220 which is not hooked up at all
//
// Pedantic detail from observation of real chip:
// The 5200 and 5220 chips outputs the following coefficients over PROMOUT while
// 'idle' and not speaking, in this order:
// e[0 or f] p[0] k1[0] k2[0] k3[0] k4[0] k5[f] k6[f] k7[f] k8[7] k9[7] k10[7]
//
// Patent notes (important timing info for interpolation):
// * TCycle ranges from 1 to 20, is clocked based on the clock input or RC clock
//   to the chip / 4. This emulation core completely ignores TCycle, as it isn't
//   very relevant.
//     Every full TCycle count (i.e. overflow from 20 to 1), Subcycle is
//     incremented.
// * Subcycle ranges from 0 to 2, reload is 0 in SPKSLOW mode, 1 normally, and
//   corresponds to whether an interpolation value is being calculated (0 or 1)
//   or being written to ram (2). 0 and 1 correspond to 'A' cycles on the
//   patent, while 2 corresponds to 'B' cycles.
//     Every Subcycle full count (i.e. overflow from 2 to (0 or 1)), PC is
//     incremented. (NOTE: if PC=12, overflow happens on the 1->2 transition,
//     not 2->0; PC=12 has no B cycle.)
// * PC ranges from 0 to 12, and corresponds to the parameter being interpolated
//   or otherwise read from rom using PROMOUT.
//   The order is:
//   0 = Energy
//   1 = Pitch
//   2 = K1
//   3 = K2
//   ...
//   11 = K10
//   12 = nothing
//     Every PC full count (i.e. overflow from 12 to 0), IP (aka "Interpolation
//     Period") is incremented.
// * IP (aka "Interpolation Period") ranges from 0 to 7, and corresponds with
//   the amount of rightshift that the difference between current and target
//   for a given parameter will have applied to it, before being added to the
//   current parameter. Note that when interpolation is inhibited, only IP=0
//   will cause any change to the current values of the coefficients.
//   The order is, after new frame parse (last ip was 0 before parse):
//   1 = >>3 (/8)
//   2 = >>3 (/8)
//   3 = >>3 (/8)
//   4 = >>2 (/4)
//   5 = >>2 (/4)
//   6 = >>1 (/2) (NOTE: the patent has an error regarding this value on one
//                table implying it should be /4, but circuit simulation of
//                parts of the patent shows that the /2 value is correct.)
//   7 = >>1 (/2)
//   0 = >>0 (/1, forcing current values to equal target values)
//     Every IP full count, a new frame is parsed, but ONLY on the 0->*
//     transition.
//     NOTE: on TMS5220C ONLY, the datasheet IMPLIES the following:
//     Upon new frame parse (end of IP=0), the IP is forced to a value depending
//     on the TMS5220C-specific rate setting. For rate settings 0, 1, 2, 3, it
//     will be forced to 1, 3, 5 or 7 respectively. On non-TMS5220 chips, it
//     counts as expected (IP=1 follows IP=0) always.
//     This means, the tms5220c with rates set to n counts IP as follows:
//     (new frame parse is indicated with a #)
//     Rate    IP Count
//     00      7 0#1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0#1 2 3 4 5 6 7    <- non-tms5220c chips always follow this pattern
//     01      7 0#3 4 5 6 7 0#3 4 5 6 7 0#3 4 5
//     10      7 0#5 6 7 0#5 6 7 0#5 6 7 0#5 6 7
//     11      7 0#7 0#7 0#7 0#7 0#7 0#7 0#7 0#7
//     Based on the behavior tested on the CD2501ECD this is assumed to be the
//     same for that chip as well.
//
// Most of the following is based on figure 8c of 4,331,836, which is the
// TMS5100/TMC0280 patent, but the same information applies to the TMS52xx
// as well.
//
// OLDP is a status flag which controls whether unvoiced or voiced excitation
//   is being generated. It is latched from "P=0" at IP=7 PC=12 T=16.
//   (This means that, during normal operation, between IP=7 PC=12 T16 and
//   IP=0 PC=1 T17, OLDP and P=0 are the same)
// "P=0" is a status flag which is set if the index value for pitch for the new
//   frame being parsed (which will become the new target frame) is zero.
//   It is used for determining whether interpolation of the next frame is
//   inhibited or not. It is updated at IP=0 PC=1 T17. See next section.
// OLDE is a status flag which is only used for determining whether
//   interpolation is inhibited or not.
//   It is latched from "E=0" at IP=7 PC=12 T=16.
//   (This means that, during normal operation, between IP=7 PC=12 T16 and
//   IP=0 PC=0 T17, OLDE and E=0 are the same)
// "E=0" is a status flag which is set if the index value for energy for the
//   new frame being parsed (which will become the new target frame) is zero.
//   It is used for determining whether interpolation of the next frame is
//   inhibited or not. It is updated at IP=0 PC=0 T17. See next section.
//
// Interpolation is inhibited (i.e. interpolation at IP frames will not happen
//   except for IP=0) under the following circumstances:
//   "P=0" != "OLDP" ("P=0" = 1, and OLDP = 0; OR "P=0" = 0, and OLDP = 1)
//     This means the new frame is unvoiced and the old one was voiced, or vice
//     versa.
// * TODO the 5100 and 5200 patents are inconsistent about the above. Trace the decaps!
//   "OLDE" = 1 and "E=0" = 0
//     This means the new frame is not silent, and the old frame was silent.

// ****Documentation of chip commands:***
//
// x0x0xbcc: on 5200/5220: NOP (does nothing); on 5220C and CD2501ECD: Select
//           frame length by cc, and b selects whether every frame is preceded
//           by 2 bits to select the frame length (instead of using the value
//           set by cc); the default (and after a reset command) is as if '0x00'
//           was written, i.e. for frame length (200 samples) and 0 for whether
//           the preceding 2 bits are enabled (off)
//
// x001xxxx: READ BYTE (RDBY) Sends eight read bit commands (M0 high M1 low) to
//           VSM and reads the resulting bits serially into a temporary register,
//           which becomes readable as the next byte read from the tms52xx once
//           ready goes active. Note the bit order of the byte read from the
//           TMS52xx is BACKWARDS as compared to the actual data order as in the
//           rom on the VSM chips; the read byte command of the tms5100 reads the
//           bits in the 'correct' order. This was IMHO a rather silly design
//           decision of TI. (I (LN) asked Larry Brantingham about this but he
//           wasn't involved with the TMS52xx chips, just the 5100); There's
//           ASCII data in the TI 99/4 speech module VSMs which has the bit
//           order reversed on purpose because of this!
//
//           TALK STATUS must be CLEAR for this command to work; otherwise it is
//           treated as a NOP.
//
// x011xxxx: READ AND BRANCH (RB) Sends a read and branch command (M0 high,
//           M1 high) to force VSM to set its data pointer to whatever the data
//           is at its current pointer location is)
//
//           TALK STATUS must be CLEAR for this command to work; otherwise it is
//           treated as a NOP.
//
// x100aaaa: LOAD ADDRESS (LA) Send a load address command (M0 low M1 high) to
//           VSM with the 4 'a' bits; Note you need to send four or five of
//           these in sequence to actually specify an address to the vsm.
//
//           TALK STATUS must be CLEAR for this command to work; otherwise it is
//           treated as a NOP.
//
// x101xxxx: SPEAK (SPK) Begins speaking, pulling speech data from the current
//           address pointer location of the VSM modules.
//
// x110xxxx: SPEAK EXTERNAL (SPKEXT) Clears the FIFO using SPKEE line, then sets
//           TALKD (TALKST remains zero) until 8 bytes have been written to the
//           FIFO, at which point it begins speaking, pulling data from the
//           16 byte fifo.
//
//           The patent implies TALK STATUS must be CLEAR for this command to
//           work; otherwise it is treated as a NOP, but the decap shows that
//           this is not true, and is an error on the patent diagram.
//
// x111xxxx: RESET (RST) Resets the speech synthesis core immediately, and
//           clears the FIFO.
//
// Other chip differences:
//
// The 5220C (and CD2501ECD maybe?) are quieter due to a better dac arrangement
// on die which allows less crossover between bits, based on the decap
// differences.
